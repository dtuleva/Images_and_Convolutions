# Images and Convolutions
### The simple, complex and convoluted notions behind computer vision

## Math Concepts for Developers Retake Exam, July 2024 @ SoftUni

This work explores key mathematical concepts used in computer vision, aiming to provide simple and intuitive explanations along with meaningful visualizations. It covers 
image representation as matrices, image arithmetic, convolutions in math and image processing, morphological operators, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Practical 
implementations utilize Python libraries such as numpy, scipy, skimage, and cv2 for image processing, tensorflow for neural networks, and matplotlib for visualizations.
